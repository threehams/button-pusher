# What makes the Internet interesting?

It is:

- Vast

It is impossible to take over the entire Internet. No botnet can ever control every device in the world. If only two people are playing, they may never encounter each other.

- Worldwide

It takes time to travel across the world, even at the speed of light.

- Intertwined

The Internet has a backbone, but it is not the only way to get from one network to another. There are all kinds of interesting shortcuts.

- Full of secrets

Networks are only visible once they are explored. There are billions of devices online, from light bulbs to refrigerators. Information can be stored in unlikely places; distractions can be produced from unlikely sources.

- Vulnerable

No one keeps everything up to date. Vulnerabilities are everywhere.

- Patchwork

Networks connect out of need. It's not pretty. While the backbone may be structured, lower tier ISPs read more like European cobblestone alleys than highways.

It is not:

- Random\*

Networks connect for a reason. A home network wouldn't connect directly to a backbone node unless there were a very good reason. A large corporate network wouldn't route through a tiny local ISP unless they were forced to do so. IP addresses aren't randomized; companies own blocks of addresses.

- Boring

Exploring a new network should carry surprises, and potentially, risks. No network should feel like an exact copy of the last.

- Repetitive

Network connectivity contains patterns, but repetition should be a strength rather than a weakness.

- Infinite

There's nothing smaller than an individual device. Local networks are no smaller than a home network with a single router.

# Distribution

Urban areas use larger ISPs, directly connected to (or making up part of) the Internet backbone.

Rural areas may need to connect through multiple lower-tier ISPs to reach the backbone.

There will be anomalies, such as fiber connections to remote manufacturing facilities, or stock exchanges having thousands of high-speed traders located within hundreds of meters of its location. These should be noticeable.

# Parametric methods

Networks can be large or small, but the structures change with scale.

## Small Network

Small networks may be home networks or small businesses. They have a single gateway (home router with wireless access point) and a flat structure. There may be 1-20 devices attached to that single gateway.

Nested networks are very rare for small networks.

## Medium Network

Needs more research. TrueCar.

## Large Network

Needs more research, as we're looking at Google/Apple here.
